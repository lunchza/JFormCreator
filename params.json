I had actually intended to write something else but found myself getting flustered with Java's built-in layout managers so decided to write a GUI creator. Thus JGuiMaker was born (later renamed to JFormCreator). Since then, I have been adding small features and fixing many, many bugs. In retrospect, the program is actually fairly poorly written however since it was made for personal use a re-write is not justifiable. Regardless, I learned a lot embarking on (at the time) such an ambitious project. I didn't know if I'd be able to translate the idea I had into a fully working program when I started, and actually managed to surprise myself.\r\n\r\n# Feature List:\r\n* Drag-and-drop form/GUI creation\r\n* Quickly create forms with labels, buttons, text fields and more\r\n* Save form templates and load them later for editing\r\n* Generate source code that creates your form, which you can then add functionality to\r\n\r\n***\r\n# Changelog:\r\n\r\nv1.25b\r\n\r\n-Application renamed to JFormCreator\r\n\r\n-Multiple selected components can no longer be moved out of bounds\r\n\r\n-Removed the check for upper-case Class names in generated source, since this isn't strictly enforced in java\r\n\r\n\r\nv1.2b\r\n\r\n-copy, cut and paste functions added to context menu\r\n\r\n-edit menu added, has the same functionality as the context menu\r\n\r\n-deleted components are now also moved far off-screen to prevent unwanted interaction w.r.t drag-select\r\n\r\n-copies of text fields now have borders\r\n\r\n\r\nv1.12b\r\n\r\n-fixed an oversight that resulted in check boxes being unselectable in drag-select\r\n\r\n-fixed certain components being unselectable in drag-mode on template load\r\n\r\n\r\nv1.1b\r\n\r\n-added a context menu to components\r\n\r\n-can now select multiple components by dragging the mouse on the main panel\r\n\r\n-Removed delete mode as it's easier to drag-select then click delete\r\n\r\n-fixed a graphical glitch that caused phantom rectangles to appear on screen\r\n\r\n\r\nv1.0b\r\n\r\n-beta release\r\n\r\n-fixed drag functionality\r\n\r\n-added the option to force event code generation\r\n\r\n-template version checking is now enforced\r\n\r\n-removed the cancel option from all confirmation dialogs\r\n\r\n-fixed a few typos\r\n\r\n-fixed the main panel being out of position when starting a new template after resizing it\r\n\r\n\r\nv0.95a\r\n\r\n-can no longer create components out of bounds\r\n\r\n-can no longer include apostrophe's or backslashes in component text\r\n\r\n-decreased maximum component size by 4 pixels to fix a bug\r\n\r\n-can no longer set component text such that the component is out of bounds\r\n\r\n-can no longer \"lose\" labels by setting their text to nothing\r\n\r\n\r\nv0.9a\r\n\r\n-can now no longer set the width/height of a component such that it falls outside the bounds of the main panel\r\n\r\n-new template now restores main panel to maximum size\r\n\r\n-added a crosshair to assist with component placement\r\n\r\n-minimum frame size of (100,100) enforced\r\n\r\n-fixed multiple issues involving the creation of null components\r\n\r\n-offset generated frame height by 30 pixels (unknown cause of original issue) *I now know that this is the height of the frame's title bar\r\n\r\n\r\nv0.81a\r\n\r\n-the main panel (virtual frame) is now resizable\r\n\r\n-components now scale with any change in the size of the main panel\r\n\r\n-program window resized to full-screen, and is no longer resizable by the user\r\n\r\n-fixed the incorrect calculation of the main panel's center point\r\n\r\n-fixed a bug involving null button creation\r\n\r\n-adjusted border on the utilities panel\r\n\r\n\r\nv0.75a\r\n\r\n-fixed an oversight where null labels were possible\r\n\r\n\r\nv0.74a\r\n\r\n-program window is now resizable\r\n\r\n-component text can now no longer contain quotation marks (preventing code injection)\r\n\r\n-fixed a bug where component text values persisted for text fields/areas\r\n\r\n-fixed an issue where check box text wouldn't update\r\n\r\n\r\nv0.7a\r\n\r\n-added support for combo boxes\r\n\r\n-added additional trace lines to help component positioning\r\n\r\n-text areas now have borders\r\n\r\n-fixed checkbox height being below minimum allowed component size\r\n\r\n-fixed an oversight where components loaded from templates weren't disabled\r\n\r\n-removed unneccessary import of event libraries when no event code is needed\r\n\r\n-generated frame now grabs focus on program launch\r\n\r\n-generated code now imports the java.awt library\r\n\r\n\r\nv0.62a\r\n\r\n-fixed two bugs that prevented the current template from being entirely discarded\r\n\r\n-fixed a bug where lower-case labels undercut the minimum component size\r\n\r\n\r\nv0.6a\r\n\r\n-support for check boxes added\r\n\r\n\r\nv0.5a\r\n\r\n-added \"delete mode\" which is activatable by clicking delete with no components selected\r\n\r\n-focus is now always transferred away from created components.
