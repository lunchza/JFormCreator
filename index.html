<hr><h1>Overview:</h1>

<p><strong>JFormCreator</strong> is a program that I wrote during a week-long strike at my university in February 2012. I had actually intended to write something else but found myself getting flustered with Java's built-in layout managers so decided to write a GUI creator. Thus JGuiMaker was born (later renamed to JFormCreator). Since then, I have been adding small features and fixing many, many bugs. In retrospect, the program is actually fairly poorly written however since it was made for personal use a re-write is not justifiable. Regardless, I learned a lot embarking on (at the time) such an ambitious project. I didn't know if I'd be able to translate the idea I had into a fully working program when I started, and actually managed to surprise myself.</p>

<h1>Feature List:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Drag-and-drop form/GUI creation</li>
<li>Quickly create forms with labels, buttons, text fields and more</li>
<li>Save form templates and load them later for editing</li>
<li>Generate source code that creates your form, which you can then add functionality to</li>
</ul><hr><h1>Changelog:</h1>
